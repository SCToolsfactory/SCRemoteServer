Actual Screens from an iPad2 

The thumb images on top act as Tabs to switch between the pages.

The pages 2,3,4 are not yet configured with the painted targets.
Hence you see unaligned target circles of page 1 as dimmed circles.

Page 5 (Emergency) is configured - but misses one commant that is not assigned
in the game (you have to map it in Game and add the proper key command here in pages.js)
